# Who am I?

I am a researcher, engineer, and entrepreneur focusing on deep learning. I am interested in fundamental research in deep learning, physics, and pure math. After receiving my PhD, I have decided to build my own start up as a technical founder.

## Research

Strong fundamental research can introduce widely useful concepts. Some of my recent research interests are as follows:

- AI
- deep learning,
- abstract algebra,
- information theory,
- statistical mechanics.

My [Ph.D. thesis](https://open.metu.edu.tr/bitstream/handle/11511/104170/index.pdf) focused on graph based analysis and comparison of deep learning models. I have a peer reviewed [publication](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/acc713) that introduces a new methodology to rank DL models in terms of estimated performance _without any training_.

During my Ph.D. I also dabbled in genetic algorithms. I was particularly interested in treating the model architecture as genotype and sharing parameters across different models. This led to a PyTorch based library, [Revolver](https://github.com/gozepolat/revolver) that allowed neural architecture search (NAS) using genetic operators while reusing model components.

## Work culture that works

After working at several companies around the world, I have distilled ten important principles:

- 80-20.
- Stay agile.
- Build trust.
- Introduce value.
- Focus on customers.
- Give and ask for feedback.
- Be kind, direct, and precise.
- Measure success without sensationalism.
- Search for the right kind of problems to solve.
- Iterate and fail quickly, yet spare time to constantly invent.

## Availability

Currently I am not available for job interviews but for networking feel free to send an email or connect via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aydin-polat/).
